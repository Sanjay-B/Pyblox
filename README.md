An API wrapper for Roblox written in Python.

The purpose of this API wrapper is to expose Roblox's API for third party use and/or for individual standalone projects.
This is the first stable Python API wrapper for the Roblox API. Documentation can be found within each module. I encourage
developers to look into the codebase to better understand this wrapper and what it can truly offer. 

If you would like to contribute, create a pull request with the changes you made. If you have a complaint, issue or problem, create an issue and I will try to answer as fast as I can. 

This is intended to fully replace the 'master' branch by providing a better API w/ more coverage. Backwards compatibility is not a priority. This is a(n) official remake from the ground up.

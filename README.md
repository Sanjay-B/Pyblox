An API wrapper for Roblox written in Python.

The purpose of this API wrapper is to expose Roblox's API for third party use and/or for individual standalone projects.
This is the first stable Python API wrapper for the Roblox API. Documentation can be found within each module. I encourage
developers to look into the codebase to better understand this wrapper and what it can truly offer.

### Disclaimer

This branch hasn't been released and is in active development. Hopefully, this version will overtake the ``master`` branch. 
This doesn't work as well as the other versions so, don't expect fantastic inner-workings. If you want to contrbute, feel free to by creating a Pull Request. Highly encouraged.
